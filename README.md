# Platform for Oncogenomic Reporting and Interpretation (PORI)

This repository contains central documentation for the platform as well as setup and installation
instructions.

The PORI Platform is composed of 5 main servers

- [IPR server](./docs/WEB.md)
- [GraphKB server](./docs/WEB.md)
- [Keycloak/Authentication server](./docs/AUTH.md)
- OrientDB server (v3.0.*)
- PostgresSQL server (v9.6.*)


## Docker Setup

The simplest way to get the entire platform up an running from scratch is using docker. Most of the
servers are auto-started together with docker-compose but the keycloak container must be started and configured on its own first. The instructions below set up the platform with HTTP for simplicity.

### Build the Authentication Server

The following command builds the basic keycloak container for PORI. This contains a base realm
configuration

```bash
docker build \
    -t pori/keycloak \
    -f Dockerfile.auth \
    .
```

Then you will run the container (change the password and username as desired)

```bash
docker run \
    -e KEYCLOAK_USER=admin \
    -e KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD=admin \
    -p 8888:8080 \
    -d \
    pori/keycloak:latest
```

Check that the docker container has started

```bash
docker ps
```

You should see something like this

```text
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                  COMMAND                  CREATED              STATUS              PORTS                              NAMES
16ff3826c976   pori/keycloak:latest   "/opt/jboss/tools/doâ€¦"   About a minute ago   Up About a minute   8443/tcp, 0.0.0.0:8888->8080/tcp   strange_chaum
```

After the container is started you can go to the admin console GUI to add a users and download the
realm's public key file. This must be done prior to starting the other containers.

The public key file will need to be passed to the GraphKB API container at run time. Copy it from the Realms > Keys page which should look something like below

![keycloak realms page](docs/images/keycloak-get-public-key.png)

For the purposes of this example we have saved it as `keys/keycloak.key` and we will mount the keys
directory to the api container in the next step. The content of the file should look something like this

```text
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEAoteEI/Iu923I4Zqt8prxIx3ljGEecnrI+sWjo4U3n14n/nY5NpfCiA+Pg1WQTQKsBHX5/sIm+Fn5FJpcpBzz8/5uEQJyPEOEezEuiP/yYjVbg4S25reOaQNRfsw7yZvdgrMySy3MrfjWw+luLa6Nt4AvZ6ywOqE8Q4SZgVxGQg07acenpR6U+bkNj3AxFFEeYqiktfKPI7iLykVBz/hXANnrs9zd036vcgAYa2IxmWpo38ZOksKTgYL5IDG1zZ5S6VM43mD7hE8jG+kCVbiNVlrYFTXxIkRmaOO9krykPoLux7tjXAFEfTwMji++HQjc724FigsnoJ3xZkUzCSzkTQIDAQAB
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----
```

Both the IPR and GraphKB API containers will use this ./keys folder, binding it into the container
at run time (See volumes section of docker compose file).

You will also want to add a couple of users to make things simpler to test. If you use the non-default
demo passwords (RECCOMMENDED!) you will need to change the corresponding fields in the docker compose
file. The names of these users can also be changed but it will require also adding them to the
application databases.

| Name             | Default in DB | Purpose                                                                                                                                              |
| ---------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| graphkb_importer | GraphKB       | This is the default user that is created when the new GraphKB DB is created. It is an admin user that can be used to add new users or import content |
| ipr_graphkb_link | GraphKB       | This is the user used by IPR to pull data from GraphKB                                                                                               |
| iprdemo          | IPR           | This is an admin user in the IPR demo db                                                                                                             |
| graphkb_admin    | GraphKB       | Admin user for managing content/users in the GraphKB web interface                                                                                   |

Add the above users to keycloak with the IPR and GraphKB roles.

Now you are ready to start the other services. This will use the `docker-compose.yml` file to
configure the network.

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This will start the following services

- Postgres db server for IPR with a default db dump
- OrientDB server for GraphKB with an empty default db
- GraphKB API server (nodejs)
- IPR API server (nodejs)
- GraphKB client server (nginx)
- IPR client server (nginx)
