# About

The Platform for Oncogenomic Reporting and Interpretation (PORI) is an open source collection of
software designed to support scaleable precision oncology. The platform has two main components:
a graph knowledge base ([GraphKB](./graphkb)) and an integrated pipeline reporting application ([IPR](./ipr)). This site
contains central documentation for the platform as well as setup and installation instructions.
