# Images

There are a number of images that can be uploaded to the report. Images require a path to the image
and the key for the image. The image key is used to tell IPR how to place the image in the report.
The following are examples with their expected format and image key.

```json
{
    "images": [
        {
            "key": "string",
            "path": "/path/to/image/file",
            "title": "",
            "caption": ""
        }
    ]
}
```
